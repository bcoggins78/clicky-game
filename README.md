#### Instructions

The Doctor Who Clicky game is a front-end app that uses the React framework. The purpose of this game is simple, click on all of the pictures listed but don't click on the same one twice.  This game will exercise your memory! After each click, the pictures will shuffle position so you will need to keep track of which ones you have clicked.  Each click will add to your score.  If you click on a picture more than once, then your score resets to zero.  The top score will keep track of your highest score.  If you manage to click on all of the pictures and reach a score of 16, then you win! While you play the game, feel free to play the Doctor Who theme located at the bottom of the page.
